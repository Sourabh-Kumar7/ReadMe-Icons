## About

The **README Icons** project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of logos representing various tech tools, development languages, and social platforms. It's your one-stop solution to find all the icons you need for your README files.

## Why?

GitHub underwent significant changes in 2020, introducing the GitHub mobile app and dark mode. As a result, finding icons for READMEs that look good across all platforms has become a challenge. This project addresses that challenge by curating a collection of icons that maintain visual appeal regardless of the platform.

## Usage

To use an icon in your README, simply include the following Markdown code:

```markdown
![Icon Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sourabh-Kumar7/ReadMe-Icons/master/icons/selected-icon/icon-name.svg)
